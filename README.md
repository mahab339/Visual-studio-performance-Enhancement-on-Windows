For visual studio prompt response. Wait after VS start 2 minutes and run with double click. You can run it every time you feel it's  getting slower.
If you feel like VS is effecting other programs that it's used occuasionally, use process explorer (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) to pause vs and resume after finish. Download it, select (devenv.exe) and from menu (Process) select (Suspend). Then select (Resume).
